Introduction
Hello! My name is Nguyễn Hoàng Vinh, a Vietnamese student. I have developed this powerful DDoS testing tool to help users perform load testing and understand network resilience better. This tool features a sleek, cyberpunk-themed GUI built with CustomTkinter, supports customizable HTTP methods, headers, parameters, and data, and allows you to specify the number of requests and concurrent threads for testing.

I created this tool to provide an easy-to-use yet effective way to simulate traffic for educational and testing purposes. Feel free to explore, contribute, and use it responsibly.

This tool is a customizable DDoS testing application designed to simulate high traffic requests to target URLs for stress testing purposes. Built with a sleek Cyberpunk-themed GUI using CustomTkinter, it supports multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD) and flexible configurations for headers, parameters, and data payloads.

Key features include:

Adjustable number of requests and concurrent threads for thorough testing.

Real-time detailed logging of successful and failed requests.

User-friendly interface with togglable input sections for advanced customization.

Visual cyberpunk design with network globe animations to enhance user experience.

Asynchronous request handling for efficient performance.

⚠️ Important: This tool is intended strictly for ethical testing and educational purposes. Unauthorized use against systems without permission is illegal and unethical.
